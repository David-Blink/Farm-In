      <h2>Field Preparation</h2>
      <p>
        Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land.

      <h2>Application Of FYM OR COMPOST</h2>
      <p>
        Flood the field before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water.

      <h2>Seed Hardening</h2>
      <p>
        Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling
        Mix 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum and 10 packets (2000g/ha)of Phosphobacteria or 20 packets (4000g/ha) of Azophos inoculants with 25 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly in the main field before transplanting and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 1) at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with 50 kg FYM and 25 kg of soil and broadcast the mixture uniformly before transplanting.
        Drain the water 18 to 24hrs after sowing

      <h2>Sowing</h2>
      <p>
        Puddling and leveling minimizes the water requirement
        Plough with tractor drawn cage wheel to reduce percolation losses and to save water requirement up to 20%.
        Maintain 2.5cm of water over the puddle and allow the green manure to decompose for a minimum of 7 days in the case of less fibrous plants like sunnhemp and 15 days for more fibrous green manure plants like Kolinchi (Tephrosia purpurea).
        At the time of transplanting, a shallow depth of 2cm of water is adequate since high depth of water will lead to deep planting resulting in reduction of tillering.
        Maintain 2 cm of water up to seven days of transplanting.
      </p>

      <h2>Precaution</h2>
      <p>
        The field plot can be 25 to 50 cents depending on the source of irrigation.
        Field to field irrigation should be avoided. Field should be irrigated individually from a channel.
        Small bund may be formed parallel to the main bund of the field at a distance of 30 to 45cm within the field to avoid leakages of water through main bund crevices.
        To minimize percolation loss, the depth of stagnated water should be 5cm or less.
        In water logged condition, form open drains, about 60cm in depth and 45cm width across the field.
        Care should be taken not to allow development of cracks.
        In canal command area, conjunctive use of surface and ground water may be resorted to for judicious use of water

      <h2>Day 3 - 5</h2>
      <p>Allow enough water to saturate the soil from 3rd to 5th day. From 5th day onwards, increase the water depth to 1.5cm depending on the height of the seedlings.
        Thereafter maintain 2.5cm depth of water.
